What Happens When You Type "google.com" in Your Browser and Press Enter?
When you type "google.com" into your browser's address bar and hit Enter, several steps occur behind the scenes within the web infrastructure to fetch the webpage:

DNS Resolution:

The browser first checks its cache to see if it has recently accessed google.com. If not, it initiates a Domain Name System (DNS) lookup.
DNS is like a phonebook for the internet, translating human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses (like 172.217.164.174) that computers use to communicate.
The browser sends a DNS query to a DNS resolver, typically provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or a public DNS resolver like Google DNS or Cloudflare DNS.
The resolver checks its cache and if it doesn't have the IP address for google.com, it forwards the request to other DNS servers up the hierarchy until it reaches authoritative DNS servers for google.com.
TCP/IP Connection:

Once the browser receives the IP address for google.com from the DNS resolver, it initiates a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to that IP address.
TCP ensures reliable transmission of data by establishing a connection-oriented session between your computer and the web server.
HTTP Request:

Using the established TCP connection, the browser sends an HTTP (or HTTPS for secure connections) request to the web server at the IP address obtained.
The HTTP request includes additional information such as the type of request (GET, POST, etc.), headers (like user-agent, cookies), and any data if required.
Server Processing:

The web server (e.g., Google's server handling google.com requests) receives the HTTP request.
It processes the request, which may involve fetching dynamic content, accessing databases, or performing other operations depending on the nature of the requested page.
HTTP Response:

After processing the request, the web server generates an HTTP response.
This response includes a status code (indicating success, redirection, or error), headers (providing metadata about the response), and the actual content of the webpage.
Rendering the Webpage:

The browser receives the HTTP response containing the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other resources (like images, videos) needed to render the webpage.
It parses the HTML to construct the Document Object Model (DOM) and renders the page according to the CSS styles.
JavaScript scripts may execute to add interactivity or modify the page dynamically.
Displaying the Page:

Finally, the browser displays the rendered webpage to the user.
The user can interact with the page, click links, submit forms, and trigger further requests that follow the same process.
Conclusion
Understanding the process of what happens when you type a URL into a browser and hit Enter is crucial for Fullstack Software Engineers. It involves knowledge of DNS resolution, TCP/IP connections, HTTP protocol, web server processing, and browser rendering. This foundational understanding enables developers to optimize performance, troubleshoot issues, and design efficient web applications that deliver a seamless user experience.

By encapsulating these networking concepts, you are not only prepared to answer interview questions but also equipped to tackle real-world challenges in web development and infrastructure management.

This summary should serve well as the content for your blog post on the web 2.0 infrastructure, covering the technical journey from typing a URL to seeing the webpage displayed in the browser.
