## 0x17. Web Stack Debugging #3

### Background Context

**The Six Stages of Debugging:**
1. That can't be right.
2. It works fine on my machine.
3. Thatâ€™s not supposed to happen.
4. Why is this happening?
5. Oh, I get it now.
6. How did it ever work like that?

Debugging can be tricky, especially when logs aren't providing the answers you need. Whether the software fails in unexpected ways or the logs lack crucial details, sometimes you need to dive deeper into the stack. Fortunately, as an ALX student, you're equipped to handle this challenge!

### Requirements

#### General
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
- Each file should end with a newline.
- A `README.md` file is required at the root of the project folder.
- Your Puppet manifests must pass `puppet-lint` version 2.1.1 without errors.
- Your Puppet manifests must execute without errors.
- The first line of each Puppet manifest must be a comment describing its purpose.
- All Puppet manifest files should have a `.pp` extension.
- Files will be checked using Puppet v3.4.

### Additional Information

#### Installing puppet-lint
```bash
