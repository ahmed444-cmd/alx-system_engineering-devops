Web Stack Debugging #0
This was the first project in a series focused on web stack debugging. In these projects, I worked with broken or bugged web stacks within isolated containers, and my task was to restore the web stack to a functional state. For each assignment, I created a script to automate the commands needed to repair the web stack.
